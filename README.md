# flunik-tools-reloaded

I've created a Window for fluink tools, the issue I'm having is the window.setInterval will not loop back in. if anyone can help that would be awesome.

#SimpleDumbDownVersion
Is just that the button, the interval function, and console.log outputs. Just trying to figure out what the setInterval isn't doing what it is suppose to.
