# flunik-tools-reloaded

fixed: I've created a Window for fluink tools, the issue I'm having is the window.setInterval will not loop back in. if anyone can help that would be awesome.

Upgrades : 
In order to upgrade you must click the allowUpgrade type, then you have to click the check box in the base tab.

If you just click the check box in the base tab and not the associated allowUpgrade check box, the script shows you what it can upgrade in the table.

If there is no check box dont be alaramed, it because you cannot upgrade anything at that time, if you leave the script running it'll fill the base tabs with check boxes.

Production, and Rt building upgrades use the same parameters as the upgrade script i made. 

POI Tab:
to update the main table press the button in the type tab.
in the type tab you have a add POI table based on coords. Input POI coords, press update button, the new POI is added in the type tab table, to clear type tab table press the clearAddTable check box then the update button.

#SimpleDumbDownVersion
Is just that the button, the interval function, and console.log outputs. Just trying to figure out why the setInterval isn't doing what it is suppose to.
